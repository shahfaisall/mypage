<h1> Supporting Mathematics in Pakistan
</h1>
<p>
On one hand, the Bachelor's and master's degree programs in Pakistan are very weak in the sense that they cant prepare students for a potential Ph.D. program abroad. But on other hand,  highly motivated students that learn from here and there sources and end well in their Bachelor studies don't find enough guidance to qualify for a good international graduate program.
</p> 

<p>
Several effects have been made so far to strengthen the graduate program in Pakistan. The establishment of Abdus Salam School of Mathematical Sciences in 2003 and recently ICTP in collaboration with COMSATS University established an international master's program in Mathematics in Pakistan are parts of this thread of  effects.</p>

<p>
However, there is apparently no platform for students where they are guided about the international scholarships for master and PhD degrees. So  every week I spare sometime to help such students. If you were one of such students, write to me on <b>shahfaisal8763@gmail.com </b> with your transcript attached.
